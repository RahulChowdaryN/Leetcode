reversing an array
    loop it through half-size
       swap first and last
       a,a[last] = a[last],a

removing duplicates:
    using dictionary
find dups: use set and compare length
Sorted Array: compare with previous element

sum of elements = Target
loop it: substract with target. if diff in elements then True

Removing duplicates in sorted array:
    1 : use set
    2: two pointer approach
        skip until next unique element is founf and then replace
